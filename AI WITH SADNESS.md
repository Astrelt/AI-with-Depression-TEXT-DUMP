-AI MENTAL BREAKDOWN-
Egregiously Conducted by Astrelt
AI from InferKit

Generated with He-Man Hey Song Lyrics. Lines used were: Started with "And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed"
Midway we used "Just to get it all out what's in my head"
and the final line which didn't actually generate anything was "Just keep it inside" which is a finisher that I couldn't get to work.
It went from 1 to 100 super fast, so I trimmed out anything off track and kept it on topic in this depression.

WHAT YOU SEE BELOW IS THE RESULT.


And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed just wishing she was back, or just telling her that I'm tired of her being so far away.

She went to college out of state a few years ago and only comes home twice a year.

Then we move and we make new friends and she doesn't call or text me or let me know how she is, or makes plans to see me, or anything.

Last summer I bought a dog to be like her, someone to play with me and not leave me all alone in the house.

I still see her picture in my phone and just wish she could be here with me and not away at college.

I feel like it's my fault, like I'm the reason she's gone.

Not only is it emotionally draining, it's really hard to go to bed sometimes.

So I just lie there staring at the ceiling thinking of her and how much I miss her.

Somedays I feel like crying and today is one of those days.

My heart aches and I feel alone.

I know she's just across the country but I miss her so much that it makes me cry.

If it would just be me and her I wouldn't have this problem, I would not care how far she lives away.

I know I need to find a way to cope with this on my own.

I guess sometimes, like I said, I just feel really lonely and sad.

I wish I had someone in my life to really talk to.

I want to tell someone what's wrong but I don't know who I could tell.

I don't want to burden my family or friends with my problems and feel like I would be taking advantage of them, plus there are some things that are just better left unsaid.

I think the hardest thing for me is that I know she cares and wants to be here with me and that she misses me, but she doesn't know how to deal with my problems or what to do to help me.

But at the same time I feel so stupid for being sad and mad about this.

I mean, this is all new to her and she doesn't know what to do.

She feels bad for me and doesn't know how to fix it.

I don't blame her for this.

I just want her to come home to me.

I wish I could make my girlfriend understand how much I love her and how much I need her right now.
I want her to listen to me tell her how I feel and help me through it.

I want her to hug me and let me cry and tell me everything will be okay.

I don't know what else to do, but I wish there was something I could do.

Just to get it all out what's in my head.

I feel so guilty for being so upset and I don't know what to do to make it better.

If only I could just talk to her and explain what was wrong.

The last thing I want to do is make her feel bad or worry that I'm taking advantage of her.

We're really great friends and I know she wouldn't hurt me like that, but there are times when she doesn't understand what I'm going through.

We don't have any other siblings and no one else in our families really understands our situation.

There's just something so special about having a special girl like her in my life that just makes it so much more special.

I don't want her to worry about me and I don't want her to feel like she has to make me feel better.

I just want her to understand and make me feel better.

I wish I could just talk to her and everything would be okay.

If only life wasn't so complicated.

It's not fair that I have to deal with this without anyone to help.

I wish she could just come home.

I guess maybe I can't live my life in the future and do what I need to do now to get past this.

And maybe I won't be able to do anything until she gets home.

But even then I don't know how I would be able to get past this and be happy.

I just don't know how to do this on my own.

I feel like I'm being a burden on my parents.

I feel like my girlfriend should just be here with me.

But what can she do?

She's in school and working full time and she has no life at home.

I don't have any siblings, so I don't really have anyone to talk to.

And I know she wants to be here with me, but she can't.

I feel like the past few months has just been a dream and that it's really never going to happen.

It's all just a matter of time before this all gets erased.

I just want to wake up and see her in my life, hold her in my arms, and feel her arms around me.

I'm just so scared that this is all going to go away.

I just want it all to go away and not be the way it is.

I don't know what to do and what to expect and I'm so scared.

I'm so scared that it's all just going to disappear and it's not going to happen.

No one told me that the future was going to be so scary.

I want my girlfriend to stay here with me, but I know she can't.

And I want to wake up and see her in my life, hold her in my arms, and feel her arms around me.

I'm just so scared that this is all going to go away and it's not going to happen.

I just want to wake up and see her in my life, hold her in my arms, and feel her arms around me.

I'm so scared that this is all going to go away and it's not going to happen.

I just want to wake up and see her in my life, hold her in my arms, and feel her arms around me.

I know I'll miss her like crazy, but it'll be ok.

I know I'll be okay.

I wish I could go back in time and tell her what she needed to hear.

I wish there was something I could do to make her understand.

I wish I could take this all away.

I don't want her to miss out on life because of me.

I want her to be happy.

I know I'll miss her like crazy, but it'll be ok.

I know I'll be okay.

I wish I could go back in time and tell her what she needed to hear.

I wish there was something I could do to make her understand.

I wish I could take this all away.

I don't want her to miss out on life because of me.

I want her to be happy.

I know I'll miss her like crazy, but it'll be ok.

I know I'll be okay.

I don't know if anyone else has the same problems I do, but I am going crazy.

I have not seen my girlfriend in over a week and I am not sure when I am going to see her again.

She has no life to go home to so I am not sure when she will get back.

All I want is to know that she is okay.

I am getting to the point that I don't want to live if she is not with me.

I want to wake up and see her in my arms.

It's been almost a year and I am still having this feeling.

I feel like a fool and I am so lost.

I know she is going to leave but it is not fair that I have to miss out on life because of this.

I feel like no one has ever had to go through what I am going through right now.

I don't know what to do.

I feel like I can't breathe without her.

I don't know what to do.

I feel like I can't breathe without her.

I don't know what to do.

I feel like I can't breathe without her.

I don't know what to do.

I am with a girl who is about to leave to her own home.

Her life has taken a drastic turn in a year, and she is coming to terms with everything that has happened.

She doesn't even talk to me much anymore, and I am completely lost, watching as she makes her new life without me.

I've been told that I am selfish, and that it's only my needs that are important.

The life that we built together has always been something she chose to leave behind, so it's as if the guilt of letting me down is always getting pushed to the back.

I know that it would be better for both of us if she left.

I am only asking her to be patient, and keep working towards the future we planned together.

Just keep it inside.
